## üìö Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started
**Q: How do I create my first batch?**
A: Tap "New Batch" on the home screen, enter a batch name, then set up each tray with food items, liners (optional), and initial weights.

**Q: Do I need to set up tray weights and liners first?**
A: While not required, setting up your tray weight and liner library in Settings provides more accurate calculations and a smoother experience.

**Q: Can I track multiple batches at once?**
A: You can only have one active batch at a time, but you can view all your completed batches in the History tab.

### Using the App
**Q: What are checkpoints and why should I use them?**
A: Checkpoints let you track weight loss during the freeze drying process. This helps you monitor moisture removal progress and learn optimal timing for your foods.

**Q: How do I add progress checkpoints?**
A: From your active batch details, tap "Add Checkpoint" and enter the current weight for each tray. The app calculates weight loss automatically.

**Q: Can I edit or delete a batch after creating it?**
A: You can delete active batches from the batch details screen. Completed batches are preserved in your history for reference.

**Q: What's the difference between original weight and food weight?**
A: Original weight includes food + tray + liner. Food weight is calculated by subtracting tray and liner weights, giving you the actual food preservation data.

### Technical Issues
**Q: My data disappeared after updating the app**
A: Your data is stored locally and synced to the cloud. Try signing out and back in to restore cloud data, or contact support.

**Q: The app crashes when I try to create a batch**
A: This is usually related to authentication. Make sure you're signed in and have a stable internet connection. If issues persist, please report a bug.

**Q: Weight calculations seem incorrect**
A: Verify your tray weight and liner weights are set correctly in Settings. The app calculates: Food Weight = Total Weight - Tray Weight - Liner Weight.

### Account & Data
**Q: Is my data backed up?**
A: Yes, all your batches, food items, and settings are synced to your account and backed up in the cloud.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Currently, data export isn't available, but it's on our feature roadmap. You can manually record summaries from the batch history.

**Q: Can I use the app offline?**
A: You can view existing data offline, but creating new batches and syncing requires an internet connection.
